## Data of the test case 202002

- Wavemaker-related measurements used as the input for the simulation TC4:
  - `PistonMotion.dat`: wavemaker position,
  - `PistonVelocity.dat`: wavemaker velocity.
- The measured water depths with six probes: `WAVE_1.dat` to `WAVE_6.dat`.
- You can also find numerical results obtained from Elena's model[^1] here. The free-surface elevations at six locations where the probes are placed are shown in files ranging from `wavemaker202002 0.dat` to `wavemaker202002 5.dat`.
