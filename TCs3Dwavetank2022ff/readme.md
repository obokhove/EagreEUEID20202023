# Numerical Wavetank in *Firedrake*: Two Method Implementations
This repository shares the source code for a potential-flow-based numerical wavetank (NWT) built upon Luke's variational principle (VP). Two numerical models have been established and implemented in [*Firedrake*](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/): 
- **Method 1**: Weak formulations are manually derived from the space-discretised VP and explicitly formulated in the code.
- **Method 2**: Weak formulations are generated automatically from the encoded time-discretised VP, resulting in an implicit implementation.

The NWT has been verified and validated through a series of test cases (TCs). Their source codes are shared to support reproducibility and encourage further development.

## üóÇÔ∏è Code Files for Test Cases 1‚Äì4
- **Method 1**:
    - `3D_tank.py`: main script;
    - `settings_TCx.py`: test case configuration file;
    - `savings.py`: simulation output management;
    - `solvers_full.py`: explicit weak formulations for the SE and SV schemes.
- **Method 2**:
    - `3D_tank_VP.py`: main script;
    - `settings_TCx.py`: test case configuration file;
    - `savings.py`: simulation output management.
- :new: In both methods, the time variables in wavemaker-related functions have been replaced with *Firedrake* `Constant` objects to improve computational performance.
- The folder [202002](202002) contains experimental data for TC4, including sampled wavemaker input and probe measurements.


## :wrench: Simulation Instructions
1. **Select a test case**
    - In the main script (`3D_tank.py` or `3D_tank_VP.py`), set the test case by changing: `case = 'TCx'`.
2. **Set simulation parameters**
    - Configure simulation-specific parameters in the corresponding `settings_TCx.py` file:
      - Set the time-stepping scheme via `scheme`: `SE`/`SV` for Method 1, `MMP` for Method 2;
      - Define the output directory by modifying the `save_path` variable;
      - Adjust spatial resolution via `res_x`, `res_y` and `nz` in the `domain` function; set temporal resolution and output frequency via `dt` and `dt_save` in the `set_time` function.
    - Key parameters that must be adjusted for each test case are summarised below. Note: `save_path` must be set individually for each run.

| Test Case | Parameters to configure in `settings_TCx.py` |
| :---:     |    :----    |
| TC1       |  Two simulations for both MMP and SV (should be run in serial): <br/> 1. `dt = min(dx,dz)/pi`, `dt_save = dt` in function `set_time`; <br/> 2. `dt = 0.5*(min(dx,dz)/pi)`, `dt_save = 2*dt`. |
| TC2a      |  Method 2 (MMP), serial or parallel.  <br/> Finest resolution for the reference solution: `res_x = 2*pi/3200`, `n_z = 64`, `dt = (Lx/3200)/(2*pi)`, `dt_save = dt*64`. <br/> Five computations with different horizontal resolutions: `res_x = 2*pi/{50/100/200/400/800}`, where `n_z = 32`, `dt = ((Lx/3200)/(2*pi))*2`, `dt_save = dt*32` remain unchanged. <br/> Eight computations with different vertical resolutions: `n_z = {2/3/4/5/6/8/16/32}`, where `res_x = 2*pi/800`, `dt = ((Lx/3200)/(2*pi))*2`, `dt_save = dt*32` remain unchanged.|
| TC2b      |  Six computations with different temporal resolutions: `dt = ((Lx/3200)/(2*pi))*{2/4/8/16/32/64}` (`dt_save = dt*{32/16/8/4/2/1}`), where `res_x = 2*pi/800`, `n_z = 32` remain unchanged. |
| TC2c      | Thirteen computations needed. The coarsest resolution for $u_{crc}$ is choosen as `res_x = 2*pi/50`, `n_z = 4`, `dt = ((Lx/3200)/(2*pi))*64`, `dt_save = dt`. The other two finer vertical resolutions are chosen as `n_z = 6` and `n_z = 8`. |
| TC3       | Two simulations for MMP and SV (serial or parallel): <br/> 1. `dt = 0.001` in function `set_time`; <br/> 2. `dt = 0.002` (`dt_save = 0.002` remains unchanged). |
| TC4       | One simulation with both methods (serial or parallel): switch between `scheme = "SV"` and `scheme = "MMP"`, 'Tend=120', 't_save=0.01'. |

3. **Output files**
    - After the simulation completes, output files will be saved to the specified directory. The expected files vary by test case: 
      - TC1/TC2: `energy.csv` containing time series of energy in the fluid domain; a series of `.npy` binary files containing 1D field data named after the time step, and `readme.txt`, which is a summary of the simulation details;
      - TC3: `checkpoints.csv` containing energy, water depths at three vertices and wavemaker-related data, `readme.txt`;
      - TC4: `energy.csv`, `probes.csv` containing numerical measurements, `readme.txt`.

## :bar_chart: Reproducing the Results
The numerical solutions can be processed and visualised using the post-processing scripts provided in the folder [post-processing](post-processing). The table below summarises the scripts used to reproduce each figure or table.

:warning: **Note**: Before running a script, make sure to adjust the `data_path` variable (and any relevant output paths) to match your simulation output directory.
